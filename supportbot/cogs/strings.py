img_tips = """
## 1. Provide Detailed Text Inputs:
- Be specific when describing your desired image. Use relevant keywords, such as colors, textures, and objects.
    - *Example: "a black and white bulldog with a wrinkled face, short legs, and a wagging tail."*

## 2. Use Precise Language and Terminology:
Use accurate language and industry-specific terminology.
    - *Example: When generating an image of a product, provide the correct product name and technical specifications.*

## 3. Supply Relevant Context:
- Providing contextual information, such as the location or time of day, can improve the quality of the generated image.
    - *Example: "a tropical beach scene at sunset with palm trees, clear water, and a wooden pier."*

## 4. Maintain Consistency in Your Inputs:
- Use consistent language and terminology when describing similar images.
    - *Example: If you describe a "brown dog with short legs" in one prompt, retain this description for similar images in future prompts.*

## 5. Avoid Ambiguous or Negative Language:
- Avoid language that could be misunderstood or result in a negative or undesirable output.
    - *Example: Avoid words like "ugly" or "distorted".*

## 6. Embrace the Model's Interpretation:
- Understand that the model's output is its interpretation of your prompt. While the output may not always align perfectly with your vision, it can still yield an interesting and unique result.

## 7. Proofread Your Prompt:
- Ensure your prompt is free of typos, grammatical errors, or unclear language before submitting.

## 8. Provide Feedback on the Results:
- Evaluate the generated images and provide feedback on how we can improve.
